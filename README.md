### Description

*** Online RPG Engine *** Tile based RPG engine with Winsock TCP/IP for connectivity. Comes with client, server, map editor, and resource editor. Uses GDI API and double buffering to display map. Should work on all Windows platforms. Features include: Animations, interchangable map file format, full tileset support, WYSIWYG map editor, chat system, and a multiplayer environment. There are no actions available as this would set the style of the RPG (although I probably will implement an object system later). Think of this as a kit to develop an online RPG.
